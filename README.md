# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mark

Iâ€™ve spent 30 years working in software â€” designing, building, and shipping real products.

I focus on full-stack applications and services, built with a user-centred approach.  
Iâ€™m driven by real-world problems, not just technical ones.

Most of my work has been in healthcare and financial services.  
Iâ€™m based in the UK, working with clients across sectors and time zones.

I care as much about how teams work as what they build.  
I try to create calm, collaborative environments where people do their best work.

I enjoy the tension between gut feel, design process, and experience in the field.  
Thatâ€™s often where the most useful, usable systems emerge.
